# City Selection UI Changes

## Overview
Successfully moved the city selection dropdown from the weather screen to the top app bar, making it available on every screen within the app.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created MainAppContainer
- **File**: `lib/widgets/main_app_container.dart`
- **Purpose**: Acts as a central container that manages the selected city state across all screens
- **Features**:
  - Manages `SDCity _selectedCity` at the app level
  - Provides a consistent city selector widget
  - Handles navigation between screens (Weather, AFD, SPC Outlooks)
  - Passes city selection and navigation callbacks to child screens

### 2. Updated Main App Entry Point
- **File**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced `WeatherPage` with `MainAppContainer` as the home widget
  - Updated imports

### 3. Modified WeatherPage
- **File**: `lib/screens/weather_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added optional parameters: `selectedCity`, `citySelector`, `onNavigate`
  - Removed local city selection UI (`_buildCitySelector()` method)
  - Updated app bar to use passed `citySelector` widget instead of static title
  - Added `didUpdateWidget()` to handle city changes from parent
  - Updated drawer navigation to use callback system instead of direct navigation
  - Removed unused `_onCityChanged()` method

### 4. Modified AFDScreen
- **File**: `lib/screens/afd_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added optional parameters: `citySelector`, `onNavigate`
  - Updated app bar to use passed `citySelector` widget
  - Updated drawer navigation to use callback system

### 5. Modified SpcOutlooksScreen
- **File**: `lib/screens/spc_outlooks_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added optional parameters: `selectedCity`, `citySelector`, `onNavigate`
  - Updated state management to use passed `selectedCity`
  - Updated app bar to use passed `citySelector` widget
  - Updated drawer navigation to use callback system

## Benefits

1. **Consistent User Experience**: City selection is now available on every screen through the app bar
2. **Centralized State Management**: The selected city is managed at the app level, preventing inconsistencies
3. **Better Navigation Flow**: Users can change cities without having to navigate back to the weather screen
4. **Maintained Performance**: Preserved existing performance optimizations while adding new functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Navigation System
- The app now uses a callback-based navigation system instead of direct Navigator.push calls
- `MainAppContainer` manages which screen is currently displayed through an index system:
  - 0: Weather Screen
  - 1: AFD Screen  
  - 2: SPC Outlooks Screen

### City Selector Design
- Maintains the original glassmorphic modal bottom sheet design
- Shows current city name with dropdown arrow in the app bar
- Pre-builds city list items for optimal performance
- Handles city selection with proper state updates

### Backward Compatibility
- All screens maintain their existing functionality when parameters are not provided
- Graceful fallbacks to default behavior (Sioux Falls as default city)

## Testing
- App builds and runs successfully
- No compilation errors
- Maintained existing performance characteristics
- Navigation between screens works properly
